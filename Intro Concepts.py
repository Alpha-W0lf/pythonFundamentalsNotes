# Data types:
# data structures are dictionaries, tuples, lists
# sets can be found in the sets library (available from python 2.5 onwards)
# lists are similar to one-dimensional arrays, although you can have lists nested inside lists
# dictionaries are essentially "associative arrays" or hash tables
# tuples are one-dimensional arrays
# String: plain text data format. can concatinate, but cannot do arithmatic.
